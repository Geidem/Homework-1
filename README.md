# Homework-1# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to showcase my understanding of finding and idenifying semantic HTML elements within a functional application, ensuring that those elements follow a logical structure within the code, as well as adding alt attributes within the application to increase web accessiblility potential. I built this project to address a specific accesibility criteria provided to me. Also to show my understanding of the importance of alt attributes and ensuring that HTML elements follow a structured, concise order as to not complicate things for collaborators.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
