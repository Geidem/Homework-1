# Homework-1# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to showcase my understanding of finding and idenifying semantic HTML elements within a functional application, ensuring that those elements follow a logical structure within the code, as well as adding alt attributes within the application to increase web accessiblility potential. I built this project to address a specific accesibility criteria provided to me. Also to show my understanding of the importance of alt attributes and ensuring that HTML elements follow a structured, concise order as to not complicate things for collaborators.
